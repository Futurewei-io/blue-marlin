We tuned the configuration. We need to index in 500k increaments and search in 1m increaments. 
the overall time to process 1m user (including hive and spark operations) is 10 minutes. I beleive we can process 50m in less than one hour.
Clustering is good enough, we do not need vector optimization such as OP.
