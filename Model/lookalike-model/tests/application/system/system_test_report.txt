System Test Report

The number of user in persona: 4,000,000
Number of record in logs table: 301,999,050
The model accuracy in this test is:  %69.34

Goal of this test: Comparing the result of extending users based on Model and based on random selection

Test case: 
1.	Select different number of seed users with a common interest in a specific keyword
2.	Randomly select extended number of users
3.	Let the model select extended number of users
4.	Calculate the CTR for above two steps
5.	Compare the CTR

Result:

The above steps have been followed and summary of result can be found bellow.
