Trainer
The SMAPE error rate of the model is 11%.

Predictor
The evaluation script (in dlpredictor process) shows aggregated error rate of 5% for prediction.
This error rate is traffic-weighted average for all valid slots.

traffic(si=A)xprediction-error(si=A) + traffic(si=C)xprediction-error(si=B) + traffic(si=C)xprediction-error(si=C)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    traffic(si=A) + traffic(si=B) + traffic(si=C)
